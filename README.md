### ðŸ“Œ Calgary Crime Data Analysis (2024)

A deep dive into Calgaryâ€™s 2024 crime data using **Python** and **geospatial mapping**. I analyzed daily crime patterns and visualized community-level hotspots with interactive maps.

- Built a **choropleth map** of crime counts per community using `folium` and `GeoPandas`
- Analyzed crime frequency by day type: **public holidays, weekdays, weekends**
- Found that **public holidays saw 7x more crime** on average than regular days
